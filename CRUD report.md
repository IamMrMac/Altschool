This report provides a comprehensive overview of the SQL queries used for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and data analytics on the sample e-commerce database.

1. Schema Creation:

The initial set of queries create the tables for the e-commerce platform, including:

Customers table: Stores customer information (ID, name, email, phone number, address).
Products table: Stores product details (ID, name, category, price, stock quantity).
Orders table: Stores order information (ID, customer ID, order date, total amount).
Order_Items table: Links orders with products purchased (order ID, product ID, quantity, price).

2. Data Population (CRUD - Create):

Queries insert sample data into the created tables:

Customers: Creates 20 customer entries.
Products: Creates 10 product entries.
Orders: Creates 20 orders with varying numbers of items.
Order_Items: Creates 50 order item entries linking orders and products.

3. Data Updates (CRUD - Update):
Update the stock quantity of a product (Product ID 2) after a purchase (assuming a quantity of 2 was bought).

4. Data Deletion (CRUD - Delete):
Query demonstrates deleting an order (ID 3) from the database. However, for data integrity, a foreign key constraint is added to the Order_Items table referencing the Orders table. This ensures that deleting an order also cascades the deletion of related order items.

5. Data Retrieval (CRUD - Read):
Several queries retrieve data from various tables:
Selecting all data from each table (Customers, Products, Orders, Order_Items).
Retrieving all orders placed by a specific customer (Chioma Chukwu).

6. Data Analysis:

Total Revenue: Calculates the total revenue generated by the platform.
Revenue per Product: Finds the revenue generated for each product.
Top Customers: Lists the top 5 customers by total spending.
Inactive Customers: Identifies customers who haven't made any purchases.
Best-Selling Products: Finds the top 3 best-selling products.
Out-of-Stock Products: Identifies products with no remaining stock.
Retrieves all items in a specific order (ID 1), including product names, quantities, and prices.
Calculates the total amount of a specific order (ID 5).
Calculates the number of orders and total revenue for each month.

7. JOIN Operations:
INNER JOIN: Retrieves data from Customers and Orders tables where a customer placed an order.
LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all customers, even those who haven't placed orders.
FULL JOIN: Combines data from all rows of Customers and Orders tables, with NULL values for missing data.

8. Window Functions:
RANK(): Ranks customers based on their total spending.
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique number to each order for a specific customer (customer ID 6), ordered by order date.

9. Common Table Expressions (CTE):
A CTE is used to calculate the total revenue per customer, then filter for customers with revenue exceeding $400.

10. Subquery:
A subquery identifies the product with the highest price by finding the maximum price in the Products table.

11. Indexing:
Queries are created to add indexes on the customer_id column in the Orders table and the product_id column in the Order_Items table. This can improve query performance for searches involving these columns.

12. Query Performance Analysis:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE: Analyzes the execution plan and cost for specific queries, helping identify potential performance bottlenecks. Examples are provided for simple and complex queries with joins.

13. Query Optimization:
A suggestion is included to potentially improve the performance of a query by reordering the JOINs to process the smaller table first (Customers) before joining with the larger table (Orders).
